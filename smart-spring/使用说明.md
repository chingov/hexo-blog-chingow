### 设计思想
* 考虑到我们的系统往往是多端（移动端、web门户、后台管理）应用，但运行在不同的网络环境下（互联网，政务网），我们为每一端设计了一个web系统。
* 虽然我们是多端应用，但业务类似。避免重复业务带来重复代码，我们用一套业务处理系统来实现具体业务，以供各端应用调用，因此我们的业务接口必须要具有通用性，可供多端应用使用，这也是对各位设计能力的一个考验。
* 多端应用公用一套业务系统将会带来并发压力，考虑到性能、伸缩性、可用性和与spring框架结合的使用成本，我们选择了阿里的开源服务框架dubbo来解决这些问题，由api提供对外的业务接口，由service来实现具体业务。`ps：对于dubbo框架不了解的同学可以学习 http://dubbo.wangxingrong.com/User+Guide-zh.htm`
* 这个时候有小伙伴要问了，那我们每一端系统中的biz层是做什么的呢？<br>
我们有很多分布式应用，各个应用之间会有业务关联和调用，biz层的一个作用就是在这里把它们聚合起来，封装成一个可供前端小伙伴直接使用的业务接口。它还有一个重要作用就是对数据的格式化处理，以满足各端应用不同的显示效果。

### 使用规范
* 规范1111 
* 规范222

### 常见问题
* Q : service项目启动时，不停刷新日志
    ``` java
    paginator.PageInterceptor - dialectClass: {***.paginator.dialect.OracleDialect} 
    paginator.PageInterceptor - asyncTotalCount: {false} 
    ```
      A : Mapper.xml中分页的sql有错误，检查近期提交的sql，特别是`parameterType`和`resultType`
